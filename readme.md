### Available Controls

#### Post Count and Offset

Set the number of items you want to display ( up to 10 ) and choose whether you want to start at the first or 100th!

#### Post Meta Query

Generate complicated post meta queries using an interface that allows you to create a query based on `meta_key`, `meta_value` and the `compare` options. Combine multiple queries and determine if they combine results (OR) or narrow them down (AND).

#### Date Query

Query item before a date, after a date or between two dates!

### Post Meta Block.

This block is intended as a framework of sorts to allow theme developers to customize how post meta displays.
